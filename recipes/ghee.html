    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I came to the conclusion that making my own ghee was an absolute necessity -
    mainly because store-bought ghee is ridiculously expensive. But when I realized that ghee
    can be used just like other oils that can be heated to higher temperatures than butter, I was really curious why that was.
    So I did a TON of research. And this Instant Pot ghee recipe is the result of all that knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Water <em>is optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter until melted</li>
        <li>Let it simmer till brown and add watter when its boiling</li>
        <li>Let it chill</li>
    </ol>
